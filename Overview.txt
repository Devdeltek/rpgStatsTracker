Ideas for improving:
	Make a new class for statistics that has a map of statsnames and values - will allow for different stat tracking depending on the game

	make the character class the invoker for the command design pattern and the stat class the reciever

	3 commands total - one for stats that are added to, one for stats that are incremented, and one for string stats

	make a game main menu that is seperate from the game session frame

	store everything for characters in a csv, don't think I need to pickle them

	0th element will be totals, 1st element will be initialized stats

	Get games and characters dynamically from the folders

	Make a list of all commands for all character throughout session with timestamps for cool display
	
	Store elements in more of a database structure for complex querying


	Include display name in characters, use that for labels instead fo char name to allow edit character button

	Add player toggle to show stats, should be simple with groupby
